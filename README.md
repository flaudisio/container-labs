# Docker Compose Labs

Miscellaneous Docker Compose configurations for learning and testing purposes.

> **WARNING:** source code in this repository is **NOT SUITABLE FOR PRODUCTION**. Use with caution!

As the main goal here is simplicity and easy testing, you'll see ugly things like:

- Plain text credentials
- Commented configuration
- Temporary files
- ...and so on

That said, I hope you enjoy!
